# AlphaBot (Group 11)

## Plan:
* Create the project proposal.

## Very very rough ideas (to be changed; variable)
* Safety: sensor for kids arm that deactivates robot, magnets.
* Dimensions: how large is the board, how large are the tiles, how large.
* Unmoveable pieces once placed.
* Camera (computer vision).
* Chips.
* Tiles arranged in a 3x3 initial storage / initial storage of tiles organised around arm.
* Sparse initial setup (optimise later if possible).
* Track chips so that they aren't lost.
