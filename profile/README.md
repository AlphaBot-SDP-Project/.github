# AlphaBot (Group 11)

## Plan:
* Create the project proposal.
* Experiment and tinker around with hardware.

## Very very rough ideas (to be changed; variable)
* Safety: sensor for kids arm that deactivates robot, magnets.
* Dimensions: how large is the board, how large are the tiles, how large.
* Unmoveable pieces once placed.
* Camera (computer vision).
* Chips.
* Tiles arranged in a 3x3 initial storage / initial storage of tiles organised around arm.
* Sparse initial setup (optimise later if possible).
* Track chips so that they aren't lost.
* Tiles that are going to be moved can be 'pushed up' so that the arm tries to grab them at a specific level (safer and more stable for other tiles).

## Project Proposal 
* Pitch: Review what was presented on Friday
* Team: Design, Hardware, Software
* Users: User Stories and Persona
* Impact: Children learning, 
* Outcome: Making a word playing game robot 
* Tasks: UI, Robot Arm (Arm Design and Arm Software Development), Board Design and Implementation, Game Software, 
* Risks:
