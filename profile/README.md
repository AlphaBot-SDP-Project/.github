# AlphaBot (Group 11)

# Current Specifications:
* Tiles: 40mm x 40mm x 10mm
* Board: base - 500mm x 500mm x 50mm (10 tiles x 10 tiles)
* Fence thickness: 5mm
* Margin space: 5mm

## Plan:
* Experiment and tinker around with hardware.

## Very very rough ideas (to be changed; variable)
* Safety: sensor for kids arm that deactivates robot, magnets.
* Camera (computer vision).
* Sparse initial setup (optimise later if possible).

### We should have a 3D model (might get more marks, and would be easier for us to envision how things are supposed to look).

## Board Plan (Joseph & Vincent)
* Select a dyslexia friendly font and colourscheme.
