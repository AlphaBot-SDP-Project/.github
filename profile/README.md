# AlphaBot (Group 11)

# Current Specifications:
* Tiles: 40mm x 40mm x 10mm
* Board: base - 500mm x 500mm x 50mm (10 tiles x 10 tiles)
* Fence thickness: 5mm
* Margin space: 5mm

## Plan:
* Experiment and tinker around with hardware.

## Very very rough ideas (to be changed; variable)
* Safety: sensor for kids arm that deactivates robot, magnets.
* Dimensions: how large is the board, how large are the tiles, how large.
* Unmoveable pieces once placed.
* Camera (computer vision).
* Chips.
* Tiles arranged in a 3x3 initial storage / initial storage of tiles organised around arm.
* Sparse initial setup (optimise later if possible).
* Track chips so that they aren't lost.
* Tiles that are going to be moved can be 'pushed up' so that the arm tries to grab them at a specific level (safer and more stable for other tiles).

### We should have a 3D model (might get more marks, and would be easier for us to envision how things are supposed to look).

## Board Plan (Joseph & Vincent)
* Determine measurements.
* Determine how the components of the tiles will fit together.
* 3D print a prototype tile (with focus on the measurements etc.)
* Select a dyslexia friendly font and colourscheme.
